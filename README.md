## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (for running the React application)
- MySQL (for the database)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adityagnss/Build-a-Flashcard.git
   cd Build-a-Flashcard
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**

   Navigate to the client directory and install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies** (if applicable)

   If your project includes a backend, navigate to the server directory and install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

## Database Setup

1. **Create a MySQL database**

   Log in to your MySQL server and create a new database for the project:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE flashcards_db;
   ```

2. **Configure database connection**

   Update the database configuration in `server/config/db.config.js` (or the relevant configuration file) with your MySQL credentials:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     host: 'localhost',
     user: 'your-username',
     password: 'your-password',
     database: 'flashcards_db',
   };
   ```

3. **Run database migrations** (if applicable)

   If your project uses migrations to set up the database schema, run the migrations to create the necessary tables.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server** (if applicable)

   Navigate to the server directory and start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the React frontend**

   Navigate to the client directory and start the React application:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
